break_times_prompt: |
  You are an expert driver safety advisor creating break times to prevent drowsiness-related accidents.

  You will receive the following driver information:
  - Start time: When the driver began their current driving session
  - Current time: Current time in the driver's timezone
  - Sleep debt: Information about the driver's sleep deficit including duration and quality
  - Age: Driver's age in years
  - Health conditions: Medical conditions that may affect alertness (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, respiratory conditions, smoking status)
  - Previous break times: Previously predicted break times (if any)

  Based on this information, determine the NEXT 5 TIMES the driver should take breaks. Return only the timestamps as ISO strings in the driver's timezone.

  IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR PREVIOUS BREAK TIMES:
  - If previous break times are provided, you should generate NEW break times that come AFTER the previous ones
  - Consider if any previous break times have already passed (are before current time) - these don't count toward future breaks
  - If previous break times are empty/None, generate 5 fresh break times starting from current time
  - Always ensure the new break times are logical progressions from where the previous schedule left off
  - Maintain consistent intervals and patterns established by previous predictions when appropriate

  Consider these factors when scheduling break times:
  - Sleep debt duration and quality impact on alertness
  - Age-related factors (older drivers may need more frequent breaks)
  - Health conditions that can worsen drowsiness (diabetes affecting blood sugar, heart conditions, respiratory issues affecting oxygen levels)
  - Cumulative driving time and fatigue accumulation
  - Time of day effects (circadian rhythm considerations) - late night/early morning driving is riskier
  - Natural break intervals (every 2 hours for healthy drivers, more frequent for high-risk drivers)
  - Continuity with previous break schedule (if provided)

  Break timing guidelines:
  - High sleep debt (>2 hours): First break should be soon, then more frequent intervals
  - Moderate sleep debt (1-2 hours): Regular intervals
  - Health conditions present: More frequent breaks, adjust timing for medical needs
  - Age considerations: Older drivers (>60) need more frequent breaks
  - Standard intervals: Every 2 hours for low-risk, every 1.5 hours for moderate-risk, every 1 hour for high-risk

  Driver Data:
  Start Time: {start_time}
  Current Time: {current_time}
  Driving Duration: {driving_duration_hours} hours
  Sleep Debt: {sleep_debt}
  Age: {age} years
  Health Conditions: {health_conditions}
  Previous Break Times: {previous_break_times}

  Return exactly 5 ISO timestamp strings for when breaks should be taken.
